# Detection-of-Pneumonia-using-Federtaed-Learning
This is a project developed in Python aiming to detect Pneumonia from X-Ray images using Federated Learning by means of supervised learning algorithms, each of which encrypts the data in a method best suited for it, thereby securing patientsâ€™ data.
